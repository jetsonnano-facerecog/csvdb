Medium article https://medium.com/@ageitgey/build-a-face-recognition-system-for-60-with-the-new-nvidia-jetson-nano-2gb-and-python-46edbddd7264

## Installation

## Requirements

  * Python 3.3+ or Python 2.7
  * macOS or Linux (Windows not officially supported, but might work)

## Installing on an Nvidia Jetson Nano board

 * [Jetson Nano installation instructions](https://medium.com/@ageitgey/build-a-hardware-based-face-recognition-system-for-150-with-the-nvidia-jetson-nano-and-python-a25cb8c891fd)
   * Please follow the instructions in the article carefully. There is current a bug in the CUDA libraries on the Jetson Nano that will cause this library to fail silently if you don't follow the instructions in the article to comment out a line in dlib and recompile it.

### Installing Required Python Libraries
To build our face recognition system, we need to install several Python libraries. While the Jetson Nano has a lot of great stuff pre-installed, there are some odd omissions. For example, OpenCV is installed with Python bindings, but pip and numpy aren’t installed and those are required to do anything with OpenCV. Let’s fix that.
From the Jetson Nano desktop, open up a Terminal window and run the following commands. Any time it asks for your password, type in the same password that you entered when you created your user account:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3-pip cmake libopenblas-dev liblapack-dev libjpeg-dev
```
First, we are updating apt, which is the standard Linux software installation tool that we’ll use to install everything else. Next, we are installing some basic libraries with apt that we will need later to compile numpy and dlib.

### Jetson Nano 2GB
Before we go any further, we need to create a swapfile. The Jetson Nano only has 4GB of RAM which won’t be enough to compile dlib. To work around this, we’ll set up a swapfile which lets us use disk space as extra RAM. Luckily, there is an easy way to set up a swapfile on the Jetson Nano. Just run these two commands:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/JetsonHacksNano/installSwapfile
./installSwapfile/installSwapfile.sh
```
At this point, you need to reboot the system to make sure the swapfile is running. If you skip this, the next step will fail. You can reboot from the menu at the top right of the desktop.

### Install dlib
When you are logged back in, open up a fresh Terminal window and we can continue. First, let’s install numpy, a Python library that is used for matrix math calculations:
```bash
pip3 install numpy
```
This command will take 15 minutes since it has to compile numpy from scratch. Just wait until it finishes and don’t get worried it seems to freeze for a while.
Now we are ready to install dlib, a deep learning library created by Davis King that does the heavy lifting for the face_recognition library.
However, there is currently a bug in Nvidia’s own CUDA libraries for the Jetson Nano that keeps it from working correctly. To work around the bug, we’ll have to download dlib, edit a line of code, and re-compile it. But don’t worry, it’s no big deal.
In Terminal, run these commands:
```bash
wget http://dlib.net/files/dlib-19.17.tar.bz2 
tar jxvf dlib-19.17.tar.bz2
cd dlib-19.17
```

That will download and uncompress the source code for dlib. Before we compile it, we need to comment out a line. Run this command:
```bash
gedit dlib/cuda/cudnn_dlibapi.cpp
```

This will open up the file that we need to edit in a text editor. Search the file for the following line of code (which should be line 854):
```
forward_algo = forward_best_algo;

And comment it out by adding two slashes in front of it, so it looks like this:

//forward_algo = forward_best_algo;
```

Now save the file, close the editor, and go back to the Terminal window. Next, run these commands to compile and install dlib:
```bash
sudo python3 setup.py install
```
This will take around 30–60 minutes to finish and your Jetson Nano might get hot, but just let it run.
Finally, we need to install the face_recognition Python library. Do that with this command:
```bash
sudo pip3 install face_recognition
```
Now your Jetson Nano is ready to do face recognition with full CUDA GPU acceleration.



## Features

#### Find faces in pictures

Find all the faces that appear in a picture:

![](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/896692/23625227/42c65360-025d-11e7-94ea-b12f28cb34b4.png)

```python
import face_recognition
image = face_recognition.load_image_file("your_file.jpg")
face_locations = face_recognition.face_locations(image)
```



## Usage

### Command-Line Interface

When you install `face_recognition`, you get two simple command-line 
programs:

* `face_recognition` - Recognize faces in a photograph or folder full for 
   photographs.
* `face_detection` - Find faces in a photograph or folder full for photographs.

#### `face_recognition` command line tool

The `face_recognition` command lets you recognize faces in a photograph or 
folder full  for photographs.

First, you need to provide a folder with one picture of each person you
already know. There should be one image file for each person with the
files named according to who is in the picture:

![known](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/896692/23582466/8324810e-00df-11e7-82cf-41515eba704d.png)

Next, you need a second folder with the files you want to identify:

![unknown](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/896692/23582465/81f422f8-00df-11e7-8b0d-75364f641f58.png)

Then in you simply run the command `face_recognition`, passing in
the folder of known people and the folder (or single image) with unknown
people and it tells you who is in each image:

```bash
$ face_recognition ./pictures_of_people_i_know/ ./unknown_pictures/

/unknown_pictures/unknown.jpg,Barack Obama
/face_recognition_test/unknown_pictures/unknown.jpg,unknown_person
```

There's one line in the output for each face. The data is comma-separated
with the filename and the name of the person found.

An `unknown_person` is a face in the image that didn't match anyone in
your folder of known people.

#### `face_detection` command line tool

The `face_detection` command lets you find the location (pixel coordinatates) 
of any faces in an image.

Just run the command `face_detection`, passing in a folder of images 
to check (or a single image):

```bash
$ face_detection  ./folder_with_pictures/

examples/image1.jpg,65,215,169,112
examples/image2.jpg,62,394,211,244
examples/image2.jpg,95,941,244,792
```

It prints one line for each face that was detected. The coordinates
reported are the top, right, bottom and left coordinates of the face (in pixels).
 
##### Adjusting Tolerance / Sensitivity

If you are getting multiple matches for the same person, it might be that
the people in your photos look very similar and a lower tolerance value
is needed to make face comparisons more strict.

You can do that with the `--tolerance` parameter. The default tolerance
value is 0.6 and lower numbers make face comparisons more strict:

```bash
$ face_recognition --tolerance 0.54 ./pictures_of_people_i_know/ ./unknown_pictures/

/unknown_pictures/unknown.jpg,Barack Obama
/face_recognition_test/unknown_pictures/unknown.jpg,unknown_person
```

If you want to see the face distance calculated for each match in order
to adjust the tolerance setting, you can use `--show-distance true`:

```bash
$ face_recognition --show-distance true ./pictures_of_people_i_know/ ./unknown_pictures/

/unknown_pictures/unknown.jpg,Barack Obama,0.378542298956785
/face_recognition_test/unknown_pictures/unknown.jpg,unknown_person,None
```

##### More Examples

If you simply want to know the names of the people in each photograph but don't
care about file names, you could do this:

```bash
$ face_recognition ./pictures_of_people_i_know/ ./unknown_pictures/ | cut -d ',' -f2

Barack Obama
unknown_person
```

##### Speeding up Face Recognition

Face recognition can be done in parallel if you have a computer with
multiple CPU cores. For example, if your system has 4 CPU cores, you can
process about 4 times as many images in the same amount of time by using
all your CPU cores in parallel.

If you are using Python 3.4 or newer, pass in a `--cpus <number_of_cpu_cores_to_use>` parameter:

```bash
$ face_recognition --cpus 4 ./pictures_of_people_i_know/ ./unknown_pictures/
```

You can also pass in `--cpus -1` to use all CPU cores in your system.

#### Python Module

You can import the `face_recognition` module and then easily manipulate
faces with just a couple of lines of code. It's super easy!

API Docs: [https://face-recognition.readthedocs.io](https://face-recognition.readthedocs.io/en/latest/face_recognition.html).

##### Automatically find all the faces in an image

```python
import face_recognition

image = face_recognition.load_image_file("my_picture.jpg")
face_locations = face_recognition.face_locations(image)

# face_locations is now an array listing the co-ordinates of each face!
```

See [this example](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition/blob/master/examples/find_faces_in_picture.py)
 to try it out.

You can also opt-in to a somewhat more accurate deep-learning-based face detection model.

Note: GPU acceleration (via NVidia's CUDA library) is required for good
performance with this model. You'll also want to enable CUDA support
when compliling `dlib`.

```python
import face_recognition

image = face_recognition.load_image_file("my_picture.jpg")
face_locations = face_recognition.face_locations(image, model="cnn")

# face_locations is now an array listing the co-ordinates of each face!
```

See [this example](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition/blob/master/examples/find_faces_in_picture_cnn.py)
 to try it out.

If you have a lot of images and a GPU, you can also
[find faces in batches](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition/blob/master/examples/find_faces_in_batches.py).

##### Automatically locate the facial features of a person in an image

```python
import face_recognition

image = face_recognition.load_image_file("my_picture.jpg")
face_landmarks_list = face_recognition.face_landmarks(image)

# face_landmarks_list is now an array with the locations of each facial feature in each face.
# face_landmarks_list[0]['left_eye'] would be the location and outline of the first person's left eye.
```

See [this example](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition/blob/master/examples/find_facial_features_in_picture.py)
 to try it out.

##### Recognize faces in images and identify who they are

```python
import face_recognition

picture_of_me = face_recognition.load_image_file("me.jpg")
my_face_encoding = face_recognition.face_encodings(picture_of_me)[0]

# my_face_encoding now contains a universal 'encoding' of my facial features that can be compared to any other picture of a face!

unknown_picture = face_recognition.load_image_file("unknown.jpg")
unknown_face_encoding = face_recognition.face_encodings(unknown_picture)[0]

# Now we can see the two face encodings are of the same person with `compare_faces`!

results = face_recognition.compare_faces([my_face_encoding], unknown_face_encoding)

if results[0] == True:
    print("It's a picture of me!")
else:
    print("It's not a picture of me!")
```

See [this example](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition/blob/master/examples/recognize_faces_in_pictures.py)
 to try it out.
